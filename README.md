 ## Installation
Just import it to your IDE and build the project to resolve the dependencies. 

## Database Configuration
Add Database credentials to `/resources/application.properties`  
The Default ones are :  

`spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/springbootdb`    
`spring.datasource.username=root`    
`spring.datasource.password=`    
`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update`    

## Server port Configuration  
Add this small snippet in this file `/resources/application.properties`  

`server.port = 7777`  
**"Server port number can be changed."**
Also the port number should be changed in functions.js file to view details of features and configurations.

## Usage  
Still under construction , some features may not work.  
Run the project through IDE and head out to the `localhost` port as set by you.
